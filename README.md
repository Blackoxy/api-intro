# API Intro

## Objectives

- Explain what an API is
- Use fetch to GET data from an external API
- Append data from a fetch request to the DOM

- Stretch: Identify API's you would like to use!

## Notes

- API = Application Programming Interface
- Internal API (things that are perhaps native to a language)
  - Fetch - the new way to handle AJAX requests
  - AJAX - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

- External/Public APIs
  - Server & database
  - We can request data from the server
    - Server queries database
  - Server packages up data and sends it to us
